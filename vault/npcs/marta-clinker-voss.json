  "content": "> *Half-Orc Fighter/Ranger — Deep Market Syndicate*\n**Marta \"Clinker\" Voss**\n*She lost three fingers to a lava dragonling at seventeen and spent the next decade figuring out how to make that never happen to anyone else — unless she wanted it to.*\n\n**Appearance:** Marta is built like a siege engine given a bad haircut — broad through the shoulders, short through the legs, and apparently immune to the concept of intimidation. Her right hand is missing its ring, middle, and index fingers, replaced by articulated iron prosthetics she had fitted specifically to hold a dragonling's muzzle harness. She keeps her black hair close-cropped and her Syndicate brand — a coiled serpent bisected by a pickaxe — visible on her neck, because she wants people to know exactly who they're dealing with. Burn scars mottle her forearms like maps of forgotten roads.\n\n**Personality:**\n*Trait.* Marta communicates almost entirely in dark humor and blunt operational assessments. She has no patience for ceremony, titles, or what she calls \"villain speeches.\"\n*Bond.* Her crew of six junior handlers are fiercely loyal to her, and she to them — she has buried two already and considers that number a personal failure.\n*Flaw.* She is incapable of admitting she is in over her head until the situation is genuinely catastrophic, and sometimes not even then.",
