  "content": "> *Human Noble / Spy — House Aurenthal (Merchant Aristocracy)*\n**Duchess Mira Aurenthal**\n*She has buried two husbands, outlasted three kings, and she is smiling at you like you might be next.*\n\n**Appearance:** Mira Aurenthal is somewhere past fifty and refuses to pretend otherwise — the silver threading through her black hair is worn like armor, not apology. She is tall, broad-shouldered for a noblewoman, with dark eyes that hold the particular stillness of someone who learned long ago not to react before they are ready. A thin scar bisects her left brow, poorly hidden beneath cosmetics, and her rings are too heavy and too numerous to be merely decorative.\n\n**Personality:**\n- *Trait:* She is extravagantly generous with wine, food, flattery, and information — and uses the giving of all four to study exactly what you reach for first.\n- *Bond:* House Aurenthal's fortune was built on a lie she did not tell, but has spent decades sustaining. She cannot dismantle it without destroying the hundred servants and retainers whose livelihoods depend on it.\n- *Flaw:* She respects power above almost everything — including innocence. She has sacrificed good people for strategic advantage and lost sleep over none of them.",
