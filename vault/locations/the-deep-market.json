  "content": "## District 02 — Deepstone Miners\n\nTwenty-three piers. Forty-three warehouses. The commercial jugular of the Underdark's most industrialized city. If goods move in Karnuk, Deepstone moves them. The Kettle — the cramped working-class district against the waterfront — smells like brine and charcoal and honest exhaustion. This is where the actual work gets done.\n\n## Notable Locations\n\n- **Deepstone Docks** — The beating heart of Karnuk's import/export economy. Grommash controls every loading crew, every ferry captain, every longshoreman's guild card.\n- **The Kettle** — Working-class housing district. Dense, loud, loyal. The people here have lived in Karnuk longer than most of the guild families have existed.\n- **Grinder's Rest** — The union hall where Deepstone workers meet monthly. Mandatory attendance. Sacred ground. No family business is conducted inside — by mutual agreement enforced by Grommash personally.\n- **Warehouse Row** — Forty-three warehouses controlled by Deepstone. Warehouse 7 is currently contested. Don't ask about Warehouse 7.\n\n## Atmosphere\n\nLabor. Muscle. Controlled chaos. The docks never sleep. The workers never stop. Grommash makes sure of both."
