  "summary": "The greatest center of magical knowledge in the world â currently occupied by something ancient, elven, and genocidal.",
  "content": "The university was built to last ten thousand years, and the architecture reflects this ambition with the particular arrogance of institutions that believe they will outlive the people who criticize them. The library's collections are unparalleled â two million texts, artifacts, and archived arcane recordings representing the accumulated magical knowledge of both surface and Underdark civilizations, gathered over three centuries by scholars who believed that knowledge was categorically neutral. That belief is no longer institutionally held. The scholars who held it are mostly gone.\n\nLuminary Haven is now the seat of the entity called The Chain â an ancient elven consciousness that predates the current age by a margin that scholars, when they had access to the archives, could not agree on. What they agreed on was this: The Chain is old enough to remember the Underdark before it was inhabited, to have formed opinions about its inhabitants, and to consider those opinions worth acting on. The genocidal agenda against Underdark peoples is not a policy position. It is a conviction held across centuries, expressed now through the resources of the most magically sophisticated city on the surface world.\n\n## The University\n\nThe university still functions. Students still study. Degrees are still granted. This is not cognitive dissonance on the part of the institution â it is the institution understanding that an operational university provides legitimacy, resources, and a steady supply of talented young mages who can be given purpose. What the university no longer teaches, officially, is anything that could be described as favorable to Underdark civilization. What it actively teaches, in certain advanced tracks available only to students who have demonstrated ideological reliability, is considerably more specific.\n\n## What the Archives Know\n\nThe question that haunts every Underdark intelligence operation is simple: what does The Chain know that we don't? The archives contain two million texts. Some percentage of them contain information about Underdark settlements, populations, defensive capabilities, and vulnerabilities. That percentage has been under active assessment since The Chain took control. How much of it has been used is unknown. How much remains is unknown. The only certainty is that the archives are still there, and The Chain has had years to read them.",
