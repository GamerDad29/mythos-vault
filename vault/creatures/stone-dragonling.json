  "content": "> *Dragon — Challenge 3 (700 XP)*\n**STONE DRAGONLING**\n*Where the Underdark meets ancient fault lines, pressure and time conspire to birth something terrible: a dragonling not of fire or poison, but of the mountain's slow, merciless weight. Stone dragonlings are territorial and tactically cunning despite their brutish appearance, using the terrain as a weapon as readily as their own claws. Their scales are layered like shale, and they shed them deliberately as a defense.*\n\n**Armor Class** 15 (natural armor) | **Hit Points** 60 (9d8 + 18) | **Speed** 25 ft., burrow 15 ft., climb 25 ft.\n\n| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |\n|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| 17 (+3) | 9 (−1) | 14 (+2) | 9 (−1) | 14 (+2) | 7 (−2) |\n\n**Saving Throws:** Str +5, Con +4, Wis +4\n**Skills:** Athletics +5, Perception +4, Stealth +3\n**Damage Resistances:** Bludgeoning and piercing damage from nonmagical attacks\n**Damage Immunities:** Poison\n**Condition Immunities:** Poisoned\n**Senses:** Darkvision 60 ft., Tremorsense 30 ft., passive Perception 14\n**Languages:** Understands Draconic but cannot speak\n\n---\n\n## SPECIAL TRAITS\n\n***Shale Shedding.*** When the dragonling takes 10 or more damage from a single attack, it reflexively sheds a layer of scale-plates. Until the start of its next turn, the dragonling gains resistance to all damage. Once this trait is used, it cannot be used again until the dragonling has not taken damage for at least 1 minute.\n\n***Earthbound.*** The dragonling has advantage on saving throws against effects that would move it against its will, knock it Prone, or cause it to leave the ground. It is immune to the effects of difficult terrain caused by rubble or stone.\n\n***Heavy Frame.*** The dragonling cannot be moved by any effect that would push or pull a creature of Medium size or smaller. It counts as Large for purposes of grappling and shoving.\n\n## ACTIONS\n\n***Multiattack.*** The dragonling makes two attacks: one with its Claws and one with its Crushing Bite.\n\n***Claws (Melee Weapon Attack).*** *+5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.* Hit: 8 (1d10 + 3) slashing damage. The target's speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of the dragonling's next turn as stone splinters rake into joints and footing.\n\n***Crushing Bite (Melee Weapon Attack).*** *+5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.* Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this attack is Stable but is buried beneath the dragonling's weight, Restrained, until freed (DC 15 Strength check, or another creature uses their action to pull them free).\n\n***Rockslide Breath (Recharge 5–6).*** The dragonling exhales a torrent of compressed stone fragments in a 20-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 24 (7d6) bludgeoning damage and is knocked Prone and pushed 10 feet away from the dragonling. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and is not moved.\n\n## REACTIONS\n\n***Spine Burst.*** When a creature within 5 feet hits the dragonling with a melee attack, the dragonling can shed a burst of razor shale as a reaction. The attacker takes 5 (2d4) piercing damage.\n\n## DM NOTES\n\n*This version plays like a slow, inexorable grinder — a boss for an enclosed space where the party cannot easily disengage. Use it in tight mine corridors or collapsed ruins where its Rockslide Breath can force Prone conditions on clustered players. Shale Shedding creates a tense decision point: the party must choose between dealing heavy burst damage to trigger it (and waste the resistance window) or chipping it down slowly. Consider placing this creature guarding a sealed chamber in a location like **Borin's Stash** — it may have swallowed something Borin left behind, visible as a dull glint in its gullet. Weak to lightning and thunder damage, which fractures its stone-layer hide, though this is not stated outright — reward clever players who experiment.*",
