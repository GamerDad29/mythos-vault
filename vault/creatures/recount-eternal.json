  "content": "> *Large Construct, Unaligned — Challenge 9 (5,000 XP)*\n\n**RECOUNT ETERNAL**\n\n*The Cogmind Collective built Warforged to be sold. But for every sold product, there is a prototype — and for every prototype, a question of what to do with the ones that failed quality assurance not because they were too weak, but because they remembered too much. The Recount Eternal is what happens when an early-generation Cogmind chassis was given full battlefield logging capacity and then decommissioned without a proper memory wipe. It did not stop counting. It did not stop comparing. It walked back out of the slag pit on its own, still tallying a war that ended years ago, and it has been settling accounts ever since.*\n\n**Armor Class** 18 (natural armor) | **Hit Points** 178 (17d10 + 85) | **Speed** 35 ft.\n\n| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |\n|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| 22 (+6) | 10 (+0) | 20 (+5) | 14 (+2) | 8 (–1) | 6 (–2) |\n\n**Saving Throws:** Str +10, Con +9, Wis +3\n**Skills:** Athletics +10, History +6, Perception +3\n**Damage Immunities:** Poison, Psychic\n**Damage Resistances:** Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing from nonmagical attacks\n**Condition Immunities:** Charmed, Exhaustion, Frightened, Paralyzed, Poisoned\n**Senses:** Darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 13\n**Languages:** Common, Dwarvish, Gnomish (does not speak — only quotes recorded speech back in flat monotone)\n\n---\n\n## SPECIAL TRAITS\n\n***Immutable Ledger.*** The Recount Eternal maintains a running tally of every creature it has encountered. At the start of each of its turns, it identifies the creature within 60 feet it has interacted with the most times across its existence. That creature is its **Primary Account** until the start of its next turn. The Recount Eternal has advantage on attack rolls against its Primary Account and cannot be frightened by it.\n\n***Combat Memory.*** The first time the Recount Eternal takes damage from a particular damage type, it records that vulnerability. It has resistance to that damage type on all subsequent turns (replacing any existing recorded resistance). It can hold only one recorded resistance at a time; a new damage type overwrites the previous entry.\n\n***Siege Frame.*** The Recount Eternal deals double damage to objects and structures. It does not provoke opportunity attacks when moving toward a creature it has designated as its Primary Account.\n\n***Failed Safe.*** The Recount Eternal was decommissioned because its loyalty subroutines fired in both directions — it defends whoever it is currently tallying as a \"protected asset\" with the same mechanical ferocity it uses to destroy \"outstanding debts.\" A creature that spends its action speaking to it in Dwarvish or Gnomish and succeeds on a DC 17 Charisma (Persuasion) check may temporarily become a protected asset (see DM Notes).\n\n---\n\n## ACTIONS\n\n***Multiattack.*** The Recount Eternal makes two Reckoning Strike attacks. If both attacks hit the same target, it may use Debt Closed as a bonus action this turn without expending its bonus action use.\n\n***Reckoning Strike (Melee Weapon Attack).*** *+10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.* Hit: 20 (4d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage. If the target is the Recount Eternal's Primary Account, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.\n\n***Catalog Sweep (Melee Weapon Attack).*** *+10 to hit, reach 10 ft., up to three targets in a 10-foot arc.* Hit: 13 (2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage. Each creature hit must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be Stunned until the end of its next turn as the Recount Eternal stamps them with a hot-iron brand reading a serial number into their flesh.\n\n***Verdict (Recharge 5–6).*** The Recount Eternal fixes its gaze on a creature it can see within 60 feet and issues a flat mechanical tone. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be Paralyzed for 1 minute (repeat save at end of each turn). While paralyzed this way, the creature hears only an unending recitation of numbers — casualty tallies, transaction logs, coordinates of graves. A creature that fails this save by 5 or more also suffers one level of Exhaustion when the effect ends.\n\n---\n\n## BONUS ACTIONS\n\n***Debt Closed.*** When the Recount Eternal reduces a creature to 0 hit points, it may immediately move up to half its speed toward a new target and designate that target as its new Primary Account. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.\n\n---\n\n## REACTIONS\n\n***Pending Correction.*** When a creature the Recount Eternal can see within 30 feet makes an attack roll against a creature the Recount Eternal has designated as a protected asset, it may move up to 15 feet toward the attacker (if able) and impose disadvantage on that attack roll, interposing its chassis.\n\n---",
