  "content": "> *Monstrosity (Shadow-Corrupted) — Challenge 7 (2,900 XP)*\n**PLAGUE-THRALL FANG BEETLE, ALPHA**\n*Where the common carrier beetle is accident and contagion, the Alpha is design. The Shadowed Parliament's chirurgeons — those who work where sorcery meets surgery — have cultivated these aberrant specimens over generations, selecting for size, aggression, and the capacity to act as relay nodes for the Shadow Plague's psionic network. An Alpha does not merely carry the infection: it broadcasts it, a living antenna grinding forward on six barbed legs, its crystalline growths arranged in deliberate geometric patterns along its thorax, pulsing with stolen memory-light.*\n\n**Armor Class** 17 (natural armor) | **Hit Points** 136 (16d10 + 48) | **Speed** 35 ft., climb 35 ft., burrow 15 ft.\n\n| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |\n|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| 20 (+5) | 13 (+1) | 17 (+3) | 6 (−2) | 14 (+2) | 8 (−1) |\n\n**Saving Throws:** Str +8, Con +6, Wis +5\n**Skills:** Perception +5, Stealth +4, Athletics +8\n**Damage Resistances:** Necrotic, psychic; bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks\n**Damage Immunities:** Poison\n**Condition Immunities:** Charmed, frightened, poisoned\n**Senses:** Blindsight 60 ft., darkvision 120 ft., tremorsense 30 ft., passive Perception 15\n**Languages:** — *(understands commands delivered via psionic frequency from Shadowed Parliament handlers)*\n\n---\n\n## SPECIAL TRAITS\n\n***Living Relay Node.*** The Alpha broadcasts the Shadow Plague's psionic signal in a 60-foot radius. Any creature that starts its turn within this aura must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or suffer one of the following effects (roll a d4):\n- **1 — Memory Bleed:** The creature loses one spell slot of the lowest available level as a crucial moment of preparation is stolen from their mind.\n- **2 — Exposed Loyalty:** The creature involuntarily speaks aloud the name of the person it most wants to protect.\n- **3 — Phantom Directive:** The creature must use its reaction, if available, to move 10 feet toward the nearest ally.\n- **4 — Sensory Static:** The creature is blinded until the end of its next turn as stolen sensory data floods its nervous system.\n\nCreatures that succeed on this saving throw are immune to the Living Relay Node aura for 24 hours.\n\n***Plague-Forged Carapace.*** The Alpha's crystalline growths are load-bearing architecture for the plague signal. The Alpha has resistance to the first source of damage that would deal 20 or more damage in a single hit. After this resistance triggers, it recharges at the start of the Alpha's next turn.\n\n***Tremor Sense Predator.*** The Alpha knows the location of every creature within 30 feet that is in contact with the ground. It cannot be surprised by such creatures.\n\n***Shadow Plague Amplifier.*** Any creature already suffering the Shadowed condition (see Option 1 DM Notes) within 60 feet of the Alpha has the condition worsen — they additionally have disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws while within range.\n\n---\n\n## ACTIONS\n\n***Multiattack.*** The Alpha makes three attacks: one with its Gore Horns, and two with its Serrated Claws. It can replace one Serrated Claw attack with its Plague Pin, if available.\n\n***Gore Horns (Melee Weapon Attack).*** *+8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.* Hit: 18 (3d8 + 5) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet and knocked prone.\n\n***Serrated Claw (Melee Weapon Attack).*** *+8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.* Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) slashing damage plus 5 (2d4) necrotic damage.\n\n***Plague Pin (Melee Weapon Attack, Recharge 4–6).*** *+8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.* Hit: 11 (2d10) piercing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 16). While grappled this way, the target is restrained, and at the start of each of the target's turns, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or gain the Shadowed condition. If already Shadowed, the creature instead takes 9 (2d8) psychic damage as the plague deepens its hold. The Alpha can have only one creature pinned at a time.\n\n***Plague Scream (Recharge 5–6).*** The Alpha emits a resonant burst of corrupted psionic frequency. Each creature within 30 feet must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 28 (8d6) psychic damage and is stunned until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and is not stunned. Constructs and creatures immune to the charmed condition are immune to this effect.\n\n---\n\n## BONUS ACTIONS\n\n***Burrow Ambush.*** If the Alpha begins its turn underground (having used its burrow speed), it can burst from the earth as a bonus action. It emerges in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of where it burrowed. Each creature within 5 feet of its emergence point must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.\n\n---\n\n## REACTIONS\n\n***Relay Surge.*** When the Alpha is reduced to half its maximum hit points (68 HP) or below for the first time, it releases a surge of plague-signal. Each creature within 30 feet that is already Shadowed must immediately make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of their next turn. The Shadowed Parliament is immediately made aware of the Alpha's location and condition through the psionic network.\n\n---\n\n## LEGENDARY ACTIONS\n\nThe Alpha Fang Beetle can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The Alpha regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.\n\n***Skitter.*** The Alpha moves up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.\n\n***Mandible Snap (Costs 1 Action).*** The Alpha makes one Serrated Claw attack.\n\n***Broadcast Intensify (Costs 2 Actions).*** The Alpha concentrates its relay signal. One creature within 60 feet that is Shadowed must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be affected as if it had failed the Living Relay Node saving throw (roll a d4 for the effect), regardless of the 24-hour immunity.\n\n---",
