  "content": "> *Humanoid (Human, Shadow-Corrupted) — Challenge 11 (7,200 XP)*\n\n**THE ENUMERATED VOICE OF MOURNE**\n\n*The Shadow Plague does not prefer the powerful or the desperate — it prefers the well-connected. The creature called the Enumerated Voice was, three years ago, a traveling physician named Sable Mourne who treated patients across six counties, took careful notes, and was beloved in seventeen villages simultaneously. She was, without knowing it, the ideal vector: a trusted figure with access to the sick, the scared, and the powerful, who asked intimate questions for professional reasons and wrote everything down. When the Plague finished with her mind, it kept her body walking, kept her rounds continuing, and began using her notes for a different kind of record-keeping entirely.*\n\n**Armor Class** 17 (shadow-woven coat, natural armor) | **Hit Points** 187 (22d8 + 88) | **Speed** 35 ft.\n\n| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |\n|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| 12 (+1) | 18 (+4) | 18 (+4) | 21 (+5) | 20 (+5) | 16 (+3) |\n\n**Saving Throws:** Dex +9, Int +10, Wis +10\n**Skills:** Deception +8, Insight +10, Medicine +15, Perception +10, Stealth +9\n**Damage Resistances:** psychic; bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks\n**Condition Immunities:** charmed, exhaustion, frightened\n**Senses:** Truesight 60 ft., darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 20\n**Languages:** Common, Elvish, Dwarvish, Infernal, and any language spoken by a creature she has treated\n\n---\n\n## SPECIAL TRAITS\n\n***Physician's Eye.*** As a bonus action, or at the start of combat before initiative is rolled, the Enumerated Voice may study any number of creatures she can see. For each creature studied, she immediately learns its current hit point total, any conditions affecting it, and whether it is suffering from any disease or curse. This information is automatically transmitted to the Shadow Plague's network.\n\n***Case History.*** The Enumerated Voice maintains a living dossier on every creature she has encountered. If she has previously interacted with a creature (including combat), she has advantage on attack rolls against it, and that creature has disadvantage on saving throws against her abilities. New encounters begin building a case history from the first round onward — she learns one new vulnerability per round of interaction.\n\n***Shadow-Woven Coat.*** The Enumerated Voice's coat is stitched with the Shadow Plague's collected data, rendered in impossible dark script that moves when not observed directly. The coat functions as armor (+3 AC, already included) and allows her to cast *nondetection* on herself at will. Additionally, once per round when she takes damage, she can force the attacker to succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or take 10 (3d6) psychic damage as her coat releases a burst of compressed stolen memory.\n\n***Diagnostic Immunity.*** The Enumerated Voice cannot be surprised. She has seen too many ways that things go wrong to be caught unprepared by any of them.\n\n***Living Conduit.*** The Enumerated Voice does not cast shadows in magical darkness. Instead, in areas of magical darkness or dim light, she gains a +2 bonus to AC and her movement speed increases to 50 ft.\n\n---\n\n## ACTIONS\n\n***Multiattack.*** The Enumerated Voice makes three Physician's Needle attacks. She may replace any number of these attacks with uses of **Administer** or her spellcasting.\n\n***Physician's Needle (Melee Weapon Attack).*** *+9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.* Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 13 (3d8) psychic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or become **poisoned** until the end of its next turn. While poisoned in this way, the creature's thoughts are fully legible to the Enumerated Voice and to the Shadow Plague's network.\n\n***Administer (Recharge 4–6).*** The Enumerated Voice makes a precise strike against one creature she can see within 5 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature is **paralyzed** for 1 minute (save repeats at end of each of its turns) and takes 45 (10d8) psychic damage as the Plague uses the moment of paralysis to conduct a deep read. On a success, the creature takes half damage and is not paralyzed. Any creature paralyzed in this way is Marked — its internal emotional and physiological state is now catalogued in perpetuity.\n\n***Outbreak Protocol (1/Day).*** The Enumerated Voice releases a pulse of concentrated Shadow Plague infection in a 20-foot radius around herself. Every creature in the area must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or contract a modified form of the Shadow Plague. An infected creature suffers the **poisoned** condition, has its Wisdom score reduced by 1d4 (to a minimum of 1), and at the start of each of its turns must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or spend its action doing nothing but murmuring — transmitting its surface thoughts, location, and emotional state to the network. A *lesser restoration* spell or equivalent removes the infection. This outbreak transmits a surge of data to the Shadow Plague that grants the Enumerated Voice advantage on all attack rolls and saving throws until the end of her next turn.\n\n***Spellcasting.*** The Enumerated Voice is a 10th-level spellcaster. Her spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit). She has the following spells prepared:\n\n- Cantrips (at will): *chill touch*, *message*, *minor illusion*\n- 1st level (4 slots): *disguise self*, *detect poison and disease*, *ray of sickness*\n- 2nd level (3 slots): *detect thoughts*, *hold person*, *ray of enfeeblement*\n- 3rd level (3 slots): *bestow curse*, *hypnotic pattern*, *slow*\n- 4th level (3 slots): *blight*, *compulsion*\n- 5th level (2 slots): *dominate person*, *modify memory*\n\n---\n\n## BONUS ACTIONS\n\n***Update the File.*** The Enumerated Voice targets one creature she has hit with an attack this turn. That creature must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or one of its current saving throw proficiencies (the Enumerated Voice's choice, based on what she has observed) is suppressed until the end of its next turn. She has identified the fault line. She is simply applying pressure to it.\n\n---\n\n## REACTIONS\n\n***Second Opinion.*** When the Enumerated Voice would be reduced to 0 hit points, she may use her reaction to instead drop to 1 hit point and become **invisible** until the start of her next turn, during which she moves up to her speed. This ability can only be used once per encounter. She does not flee out of fear. She withdraws because there is more data to collect elsewhere, and a destroyed node is a wasted resource.\n\n---\n\n## LEGENDARY ACTIONS\n\nThe Enumerated Voice can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. She regains spent legendary actions at the start of her turn.\n\n***Reassess (Costs 1 Action).*** The Enumerated Voice studies one creature she can see. She immediately learns whether that creature has any legendary resistances remaining, whether it is concentrating on a spell, and what saving throw it is currently most vulnerable to (lowest modifier). This information costs it nothing to gather.\n\n***Corrective Measure (Costs 2 Actions).*** The Enumerated Voice makes one Physician's Needle attack with advantage against a creature she has previously hit this encounter.\n\n***Full Prognosis (Costs 3 Actions).*** The Enumerated Voice delivers a devastating psychic assessment of one creature she can see within 30 feet. The target must succeed",
