  "content": "> *Huge Construct, Neutral Evil — Challenge 13 (10,000 XP)*\n\n**MIRRORBOUND COLOSSUS**\n\n*No one knows who built the first one. The records in Thyssel's great library describe them only as \"the watching men of glass,\" constructed by a civilization so obsessed with truth that they eventually built something that could enforce it. They stand in the ruins of old cities now, perfectly still, perfectly intact — and when someone lies in their presence, they wake up.*\n\n**Armor Class** 18 (natural armor) | **Hit Points** 230 (20d12 + 100) | **Speed** 40 ft.\n\n| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |\n|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| 26 (+8) | 8 (−1) | 21 (+5) | 6 (−2) | 18 (+4) | 6 (−2) |\n\n**Saving Throws:** STR +13, CON +10, WIS +9\n**Skills:** Insight +14, Perception +9\n**Damage Immunities:** Poison, Psychic; Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing from nonmagical attacks\n**Condition Immunities:** Charmed, Exhaustion, Frightened, Paralyzed, Petrified, Poisoned\n**Senses:** Truesight 120 ft., passive Perception 19\n**Languages:** Understands all languages but cannot speak\n\n---\n\n***Read-Aloud:***\n*\"The chamber is full of mirrors. That's what you think at first — mirrors arranged in a rough humanoid shape, a dozen feet tall, standing at the room's center with its back to you. Then you realize the surface is moving. Not dramatically — just the faintest ripple, like water disturbed by a stone dropped a long time ago. The figure is made entirely of polished silver glass, each pane pressed against the next with no seam, no joint, no visible mechanism. You can see yourselves in it. All of you. But the reflections aren't doing quite what you're doing — they're looking at you, and their expressions are not your expressions.*\n\n*One of them raises its hand.*\n\n*None of you did that.*\n\n*Then the giant turns, and you discover it has no face — only one enormous mirror where a face should be, and in it, you see every lie you have ever told playing back at you in rapid, silent succession.\"*\n\n---\n\n## SPECIAL TRAITS\n\n***Deception Sense.*** The Mirrorbound Colossus knows the instant any creature within 60 feet of it speaks a deliberate lie. It cannot be deceived by illusions, disguises, or false statements of any kind. It has advantage on all Wisdom (Insight) checks.\n\n***Reflective Carapace.*** When the Colossus is targeted by a spell that requires an attack roll, roll a d6. On a 6, the spell is reflected back at its caster at the original spell save DC or attack bonus. Spells that deal damage deal half their damage to the Colossus and their full damage to the caster.\n\n***Mirror Step.*** The Mirrorbound Colossus can enter any reflective surface (mirror, still water, polished metal) of at least 2 square feet and emerge from any other such surface within 120 feet as part of its movement. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.\n\n***Truth's Weight.*** Any creature that lies within 60 feet of the Colossus must succeed on a DC 17 Charisma saving throw or take 10 (3d6) psychic damage and be unable to speak falsehoods for the next minute. A creature that succeeds on this save is immune to Truth's Weight for 24 hours.\n\n***Immutable Form.*** The Colossus is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.\n\n***Magic Weapons.*** The Colossus's attacks are magical.\n\n---\n\n## ACTIONS\n\n***Multiattack.*** The Mirrorbound Colossus makes two Shardstrike attacks.\n\n***Shardstrike (Melee Weapon Attack).*** *+13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target.* Hit: 22 (4d6 + 8) slashing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn as mirror fragments catch the light in their eyes.\n\n***Face of Judgment (Recharge 5–6).*** The Colossus tilts its mirror face toward up to three creatures it can see within 60 feet. Each target must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 45 (10d8) psychic damage and is stunned until the end of its next turn as it is forced to witness an undeniable truth about itself — a secret it has buried, a moment of cowardice, the face of someone it has wronged. On a successful save, it takes half damage and is not stunned.\n\n***Mirror Shatter (1/Day).*** The Colossus detonates three of its glass panels outward in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 52 (8d12) slashing damage on a failed save, or half on a success. The Colossus then loses 40 hit points as part of itself is destroyed. The panels do not regenerate.\n\n---\n\n## LEGENDARY ACTIONS\n\nThe Mirrorbound Colossus has 3 legendary actions, which it can use at the end of another creature's turn. It regains all spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.\n\n***Gaze (1 Action).*** The Colossus fixes its mirror face on one creature it can see within 60 feet. That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on its next attack roll or ability check as its own reflected expression distracts it.\n\n***Step (2 Actions).*** The Colossus uses its Mirror Step feature.\n\n***Splinter (3 Actions).*** The Colossus slams both arms into the ground. The floor in a 20-foot radius around it becomes difficult terrain covered in mirror shards. Any creature that moves through this area takes 7 (2d6) slashing damage per 5 feet traveled until the area is cleared.\n\n---",
