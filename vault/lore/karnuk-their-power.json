It's like the machines bow to them. I don't know what that means. I don't want to know what that means.\"\n\n> \"Their weapons aren't forged. They're grown from the city's embersteel veins. That's why they hum like living things. Because they are.\"\n\n> \"Don't fight them in alleys. The shadows belong to them. Don't fight them in the squares. The light belongs to them. Don't fight them at all. There is no location where your odds improve.\"\n\n> \"Once, a Steel Syndicate boss tried to buy an Iron Order patrol. The next morning, his forge was found filled with ash — still burning. Still warm. Nobody went in. Nobody came out.\""
