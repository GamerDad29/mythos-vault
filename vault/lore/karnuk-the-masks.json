None are safe to repeat too loudly.*\n\n> \"Those masks aren't armor — they're their faces. Once you put it on, it fuses. No one's ever seen an Iron Order man unmasked. Not even when they die.\"\n\n> \"The masks don't hide faces. They hide nothing. Inside there's only smoke and echo.\"\n\n> \"If you look too long into the mask's runes, you'll see your own crimes written back at you. Every one of them.\"\n\n> \"The masks glow brighter when danger comes. That's when you run. Before you can think about it. Before your legs catch up with what your eyes have seen.\""
