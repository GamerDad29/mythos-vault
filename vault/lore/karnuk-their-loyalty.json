They've executed their own cousins for trying. Not the cousin who offered the bribe. The cousin who stood there and watched it happen.\"\n\n> \"They say Vorgoth doesn't command them. He asks. And if he asks for the wrong thing, they'll tell him. Once.\"\n\n> \"Each Phalanx is four different bloodlines — hobgoblin, duergar, drow, bugbear — so no one family can claim them as kin. That was by design. That was always by design.\"\n\n> \"The Iron Order were the first militia, back when Karnuk was a camp of exiles. They never left. Every other power structure in this city came after them. They're still here.\""
