We seal it.\"*\n\nSixty years before the current age, a battlefield cleric named Maeris Vol walked out of a siege that killed every other soul in a forward hospital and declared that she had spoken with a god — not *her* god, not any god with a temple or a tithe — but something older, something that existed in the space between divine portfolios, in the wound that never quite closes. She called it the Sealed One. Her church called her a heretic. She called her church insufficient, and walked away. Twelve soldiers followed her. Their descendants — spiritual and sometimes literal — number in the thousands.\n\nThe Order of the Cauterized Saint does not worship healing. They worship *the scar.* They believe that suffering, properly honored and survived, becomes something indestructible — that the wound site, once sealed, is stronger than the flesh that surrounded it. They are theologians of damage, physicians of the *permanent,* and the most feared battlefield medics in the known world, because their treatment philosophy includes, without apology, the willingness to amputate anything that threatens the whole.\n\n---\n\n**Overview**\n\n| Detail | Info |\n|---|---|\n| **Founding** | ~60 years ago; exact date disputed by the Order itself as \"irrelevant — the scar predates the wound\" |\n| **Headquarters** | The Reliquary of First Ash — a fortress-monastery built into a volcanic cliff on the border between Karnuk and Vragathul |\n| **Leader** | The Grand Cauterizer, currently a dwarf named **Brom Haldane** who lost his left arm at age nineteen and has never sought to replace it |\n| **Membership** | ~1,200 Knights Cauterized; ~4,000 lay members (medics, surgeons, theologians) |\n| **Allegiance** | The Order serves *survival,* not states — they take contracts from Karnuk and Vragathul but kneel to neither |\n| **Symbol** | A white flame inside a closed fist — deliberately echoing, and deliberately *challenging,* the Ashen Compact's imagery |\n| **Motto** | *\"Scar, not wound. Seal, not weep.\"* |\n\n---\n\n**History & Lore**\n\nMaeris Vol's original twelve followers were soldiers who had survived things they shouldn't have. One had lost both eyes and continued fighting by sound and memory. One had been declared dead twice by regimental surgeons and woke up both times. One had watched an alchemical compound — historians with access to Compact archives suspect it was an early, unstabilized version of **Veth's Blue** — consume an entire field hospital and crawled out of the ashes with her lungs permanently scarred, breathing with a sound like distant wind for the rest of her long life. Maeris called these people not *lucky,* but *chosen* — not by any single god's favor, but by the fundamental force of *continuance.* The universe, she argued, had looked at each of them and decided: *not yet.* That decision carried theological weight. It carried *obligation.*\n\nThe Order's early decades were chaotic and violent. They were expelled from three city-states for their practice of **Sealing** — a ritual that involves deliberately scarring an initiate's dominant hand with a heated iron bearing the Order's sigil, performed on the day they complete their training. Rulers objected not to the theology but to the optics: an army of soldiers whose first act of devotion was *self-inflicted damage* made nervous those who employed them. The Order countered that a soldier who has already chosen pain cannot be controlled by the threat of it. This argument did not make them more welcome, but it made them more *true.*\n\nTheir relationship with the **Blackfire Alchemists** is commercially significant and personally contemptuous. The Order purchases alchemical supplies in bulk — cauterizing compounds, analgesic tinctures, field-stabilization reagents. They pay on time and in full. They have, on seven separate documented occasions, publicly accused Blackfire Alchemists of selling them compounds that were either diluted, mislabeled, or \"optimized for sale rather than survival.\" Zogrin Blackfire has responded to these accusations by sending better products and no apology. The Order considers this a form of respect. They are not wrong.\n\nThe emergence of **Spellfire** has given the Order's theologians something to argue about for",
