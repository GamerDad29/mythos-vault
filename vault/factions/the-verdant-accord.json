  "type": "FACTION",
  "category": "Balance Covenant",
  "summary": "Two organizations that used to argue about methods realized they shared the same enemy. The alliance is practical. The conviction is not.",
  "content": "The Harpers and the Emerald Enclave spent centuries disagreeing about almost everything except the conclusion: the balance of the world matters, the powerful must be checked, and someone has to do the work of ensuring that no single force — magical, political, or natural — achieves the kind of dominance that ends the story for everyone else. They fought each other twice over tactics. They argued for a generation about whether civilization or nature takes precedence when they conflict. Then the world changed in ways that made those arguments feel academic, and they stopped having them.\n\nThe Verdant Accord is not a merger. Both organizations still exist, with their own cultures, their own methods, and their own internal disagreements. What changed is that they now share intelligence, coordinate operations, and have agreed — in writing, binding, with provisions for enforcement — not to undermine each other's work even when they think the other is doing it wrong. This agreement covers approximately seventy percent of relevant situations. The other thirty percent are addressed case by case, with considerable argument and occasional shouting.\n\n## What They Oppose\n\nThe Accord opposes dominance. Specifically: the kind of dominance that forecloses alternatives, that makes the world smaller, that removes the possibility of things being different. The Chain in Luminary Haven. Concentrations of arcane power that answer to nothing. Forces that operate by the logic that if they win, there is no longer a game. The Accord's members have different reasons for opposing these things — some philosophical, some personal, some rooted in a commitment to nature that doesn't require justification. The shared conclusion is enough.\n\n## The Cost of Agreement\n\nWorking with people you disagree with is difficult. The Accord's members are honest about this in ways that make outsiders uncomfortable. Harper operatives think some Enclave members are naive about civilization. Enclave druids think some Harper operatives are arrogant about their judgment. Both are sometimes right. The agreement holds because the alternative — opposing each other while something worse wins — is worse than the disagreement.",
