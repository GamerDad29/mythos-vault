The faithful who remained in those spaces, continuing to pray out of grief or habit or stubbornness, began to hear something they describe not as a voice but as an *intention* — the shape of a response without the content, the grammar of divine communication with the vocabulary stripped out. The first people to interpret rather than flee this sound called themselves the Remainders, and the Congregation grew from there.\n\n**Sphere of Influence:** The Last Congregation exists in **ecological niches** — specifically the niches left behind when a religious institution collapses. Abandoned temples, deconsecrated chapels repurposed into granaries, neighborhoods where a deity's shrines have been plastered over by the clergy of successor gods. They have a notable presence in the older under-infrastructure of the Pathways Unseen, where the Syndicate Shadows and Crimson Concordat conduct their operations above ground they rarely think to look beneath.\n\n**Public Face:** There isn't one. The Last Congregation does not proselytize, does not recruit openly, and does not advertise. It is found by people who are already looking for it, which is how its members prefer it. To the outside world, if they are noticed at all, they appear to be a loosely organized group of religious eccentrics who hold vigil in abandoned holy sites. Sad, harmless, probably a little unwashed.\n\n**True Purpose:** The Last Congregation believes that a god's death is not instantaneous. They believe it is a *process,* potentially millennial in scale — that what mortals interpret as a god going silent is actually the early stage of a vastly slow divine death-rattle, and that the prayers of the remaining faithful are the only thing keeping that process from accelerating to completion. They are, in their own understanding, *keeping their gods alive.* And they have mounting evidence that they are right. The prayers do something. The Remainders who pray longest in the resonant spaces begin to develop what can only be called *miracles* — unpredictable, uncontrolled, aesthetically coherent with the dead deity's portfolio but wild in execution, like a divine power trying to express itself through an instrument it was never designed to use.\n\nThey are not trying to resurrect their gods. They are trying to survive with them long enough for the gods to figure out how to *not die.*\n\n**Structure:** Flat, congregational, and frequently chaotic. There is no hierarchy because their theology doesn't support one — if their god is in the process of dying rather than dead, then no mortal can claim superior access to divine will, because the divine will is currently in crisis and not handing out clear instructions. Decisions are made by vigil: anyone who wants to weigh in sits in the resonant space and prays until consensus emerges, which takes as long as it takes.\n\nThree roles exist, not as ranks but as *functions:*\n- **Vigil-Keepers:** Those who maintain continuous prayer in the resonant spaces. They are the congregation's most important members and its most burned-out.\n- **Readers of the Noise:** Those with a talent for interpreting the intentional-sound, serving as improvisational oracles. Their pronouncements are genuinely unpredictable and genuinely sometimes accurate.\n- **The Wandering:** Former members who have left physical vigil and carry the practice with them into the world, praying wherever they go, trying to establish new resonances in new spaces.\n\n**Key Figures:**\n\n- **Ysolde the Last Acolyte** (Final ordained priest of a god whose name the Congregation no longer speaks aloud): Ysolde was ordained seventeen years before her deity went silent and has maintained her vigil in the same underground chamber for eleven years since. She is the oldest continuous Vigil-Keeper and the closest thing the Congregation has to a leader, which she refuses to be called. She is gaunt, luminous with something that reads as either profound peace or profound dissociation, and her miracles are the most powerful and least controllable of any in the Congregation. She believes they are winning. She is the only one who has felt her god's \"response\" get slightly stronger in the past year, and she has not told anyone because she doesn't want them to get their hopes up.\n\n- **Derrick Pallsworth, called the Doubter** (Reader of the Noise and most prominent internal critic): Pallsworth is a middle-aged former schoolteacher who came to the Congregation five years ago and has never fully convinced himself it isn't all collective grief hallucination. He stays because the miracles are real — he has seen them, catalogued them, subjected them to every rational examination he could design — and the miracles are unambiguously real. He stays because he cannot explain the miracles any other way. He is the faction's most honest voice and its most destabilizing presence. His agenda is *verification* — he wants an outside expert to confirm or deny what the Congregation believes. He is the most likely to approach the players.\n\n- **Sister-Wandering Tova Kess** (The Wandering, formerly of the Vigil): Tova left the underground chamber two years ago when her miracle-manifestations became violent — she was involuntarily calling fire in her sleep, her dead god having had a solar portfolio. She travels now, sleeping in short shifts, praying constantly, and looking for other Wandering who have experienced escalation. She believes there is a *pattern* to which Congregants are escalating and why, and she suspects it has to do with proximity to something she calls \"the deposit\" — the same physical phenomenon the Hollow Synod calls sediment, though the two groups have not yet discovered each other, which is a situation with significant dramatic potential.\n\n**Resources:**\n\n- **Resonant Spaces:** The Congregation's most irreplaceable assets — the physical locations where their prayer-work is anchored. Losing a resonant space (through collapse, desecration, or discovery by hostile parties) is a catastrophic blow. They have three primary spaces and several minor ones.\n- **The Miracle-Workers:** Seventeen members of the Congregation currently manifest divine miracles with regularity. They are untrained, unpredictable, and extraordinarily powerful in specific and narrow contexts. They are the faction's force-projection capability and its biggest liability.\n- **Time:** They have been doing this for decades. They know things about divine death as a process that no theological institution knows because no theological institution has sat in the same room with a dying god for eleven years taking notes.\n\n**Faction Hook:** A neighborhood in a city the players frequent has started experiencing small, inexplicable events — fires that go out the moment they threaten to spread, lost children found sleeping safely in the exact spot they went missing, a persistent smell of rain in an area with no drainage. The events correspond to the portfolio of a god no one currently alive remembers worshipping. Below the neighborhood's oldest building, something is praying.",
